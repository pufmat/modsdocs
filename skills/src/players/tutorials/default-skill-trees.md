# Installing Default Skill Trees tutorial

## Installing Pufferfish's Skills

First step is to download and install the mod Pufferfish's Skills which is a framework to create fully configurable skill systems.

- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/skills

If you are sure you have installed the mod correctly you don't need to launch the game now. However when you do so and press <kbd>K</kbd> a screen should open. At this point you haven't downloaded any skill trees yet, so every thing you will see is a message "There doesn't seem to be anything here...".

## Installing Pufferfish's Attributes

The second step is to install Pufferfish's Attributes mod which is a dependency of Default Skill Trees mod. It is required as in vanilla there are few interesting attributes, so without that mod the skill tree couldn't do much. Pufferfish's Attributes.

Pufferfish's Attributes mod can be downloaded on the following websites:
- CurseForge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/puffish-attributes
- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/attributes

To test if it is installed and works you can start the game and type `/attribute @s puffish_attributes:` command and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>. If you see suggestions of attributes starting with `puffish_attributes` the mod is installed correctly.
