# Prototypes

Prototypes are used to represent in-game objects and their relations in config. They have operations which are like functions and transforms them into different prototypes. The main use of prototypes are [experience sources](/creators/configuration/experience-sources/experience-source) that calculate experience using [expressions](/creators/configuration/expression) based on numbers extracted from in-game objects.

::: info
Custom prototypes can be added using API.
