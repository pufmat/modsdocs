# Root skills

Root skills are starting point in the skill tree. They behave differently depending on `exclusive_root` option value set in `category.json`.

When `exclusive_root` is set to `false`, or is not set at all. Then all root skills are available to unlock at any time.

When `exclusive_root` is set to `true`. Then all root skills are available, but after one of them is unlocked, other root skills became locked. However they can still be later unlocked just like normal skills.
