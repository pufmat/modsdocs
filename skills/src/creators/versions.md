# Versions

The version of the mod is described by `X.Y.Z`

- `X` - Incremented when major change is made.
- `Y` - Incremented when a regular change is made without breaking config or API.
- `Z` - Incremented when fixing a bug for a specific game version or mod loader version.

Until the mod becomes stable, so that until X becomes greater than 0, incrementing Y may break config or API.
